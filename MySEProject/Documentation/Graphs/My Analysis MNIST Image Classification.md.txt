5. Added Image dataset from MNIST for digits 0,1 and 2.
6. Run Exp.4 for 0,1 and 2 and updated the result.
7. Ran Exp 5 with the following changes and results:
Changes & Results:
1. Image 'Result 1' is obtained after removing the color threshold and keeping the InputDimensions
Parameter in htmconfig json file as 28x28.
2. The result of image 'Result 1' is not satisfactory and the correlation is bad.
3. Image 'Result 2' is obtained after activating the color threshold as 200,200,200 and keeping the InputDimensions
Parameter in htmconfig json file as 100x100.
4. The result of image 'Result 2' is not satisfactory and the correlation is bad as compared to the result obtained in Exp 4
using the sae dataset with input dimentions 100x100 and colorthreshold as 10,10,10.
